### Extraction of Sodium Hydroxide Through Electrolsyis of Brine

Here is a lab report I wrote after attempting to extract the base Sodium Hydroxide from a salt and water (brine) solution. <br/>
ChemRxviv Status: Awaiting Approval <br/>
Abstract: <br/>
NaOH-1 is formed when NaCL+H2O (aq) is electrolyzed. Out of the anode, chlorine gas
is made- though in small amounts. From the cathode, hydrogen gas is produced, and the salt and
water solution forms into sodium hydroxide, as shown in the chemical equation below:<br/>
2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) → H2(g) + Cl2(g) + 2NaOH(aq)<br/>
There are two common methods of using electrolysis to produce NaOH: the Mercury
Process and the Membrane Cell. In the Mercury Process, the anode (positive electrode) is
titanium, and the cathode is mercury (at the bottom of the cell)<br/>
Anode reaction (oxidation):<br/>
2Cl-(aq) → Cl2(g) + 2e<br/>
Cathode reaction (reduction):<br/>
Na+(aq) + e- → Na(s)<br/>
Once the salt dissolves in the liquid mercury, it makes a substance known as an amalgam
which is removed from the solution by a decomposer. Once separated, the amalgam reacts with
H2O, forming sodium hydroxide and two other by-products.<br/>
The preferred method of producing NaOH is the Membrane Cell. In this process, a
membrane allows only salt and water solution to flow to the cathode. The anode is made from
titanium, and the cathode from nickel.<br/>
Anode reaction (oxidation):<br/>
2Cl-(aq) → Cl2(g) + 2e<br/>
Cathode reaction (reduction):<br/>
2H2O(l) + 2e- → H2(g) + 2OH-(aq)<br/>
The product of this reaction is sodium hydroxide and two other by-products. However,
due to the absence of the harmful mercury, this process is favoured.<br/>
Therefore, in this study, a modified version of this process was used to produce sodium
hydroxide. The sodium hydroxide produced had a basic pH, but it was still dilute (20%-25%
concentration). One battery leaked acid, resulting in an acid-base neutralization reaction which
produced an unknown green salt. This salt later turned orange on contact with air.<br/>
